                            <p>A student app is a category of communication programs designed for students to establish connectivity with teachers. It is a software that acts as a bridge between the students, schools and families, with the school management facilitating, overseeing and managing the entire school communication activities.

                            <p>A student app enables students to plan their studies, facilitate online learning and enable students to learn and be updated with their school activities in an organized way. Moreover, it allows students to establish a secure and user-friendly way to communicate with teachers and discuss their school related activities. A student app differs from traditional communication channels like SMS and email, because it is more efficient, has student-friendly secure features and stellar privacy-oriented infrastructure to protect any student and provide them with a safe and secure school environment.</p>

                        <p class="para_benefitapptop">The student apps come with advanced features like Private Chat, Live Broadcasting, Stories, Teachers' Drive, Emergency messaging, and more. These enable the student app to be more engaging and effective than ineffective, expensive conventional channels like emails and SMSs. Moreover, the security and privacy provided by these school apps allow the school to create a safe and secure school communication ecosystem that any other type of application can't offer. In addition, certain unique benefits come with student apps. Here are six benefits you can get by adding a student app to your school or educational institution:

                            <p>One significant advantage the student apps have is that they can bring all the school communication activities in one place.

It also saves time for parents who are always on a busy schedule to keep updated about their children's school on the go.</p>
